FactoryBean子接口
增加了两个方法

 boolean
 
isEagerInit()
           Does this FactoryBean expect eager initialization, that is, eagerly initialize itself as well as expect eager initialization of its singleton object (if any)?

 boolean
 
isPrototype()
           Is the object managed by this factory a prototype? That is, will FactoryBean.getObject() always return an independent instance?
